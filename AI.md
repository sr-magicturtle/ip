## Increment A-BetterGui
### Perplexity's Claude Sonnet
Firstly, the AI had difficulty in understanding separate parts of code. 
I had to manually upload my files into the AI to get it to work. 

### Commit "Add background", "Add dialog bubble", "Add resizing functionality" 
Surprisingly, although I forgot to upload a file: MainWindow.fxml and DialogBox.fxml,
it was able to apply almost-similar configurations to what I already had. 
It was much simpler, without having to research the necessary parameters.
