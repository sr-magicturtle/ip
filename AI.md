which tool you used for which increment 
interesting observations (e.g., what worked? what didn't? overall, how much time did it save?)

I used Perplexity's Claude Sonnet for increment **A-BetterGui**.
Firstly, the AI had difficulty in understanding separate parts of code. 
I had to manually upload my files into the AI to get it to work. 

Commit "Add background", Commit "Add dialog bubble"
Surprisingly, although I forgot to upload a file: MainWindow.fxml and DialogBox.fxml,
it was able to apply almost-similar configurations to what I already had. 
It was much simpler, without having to research the necessary parameters.
